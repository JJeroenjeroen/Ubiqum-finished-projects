Hello!
This document gives a short description of the files in this map.



1)
Exploratory files:
- Contains 1 R file created to do some initial exploration of the dataset.


2)
Full set analysis:
- Contains a setup, modeling and error analysis of the full dataset. 
- Here the performance metrics for predicting the building accuracy can be found


3)
Seperate building analysis
- This map contains seperate maps where either floors or location (Longitude & Latitude) are predicted
- The R file "Performance metrics for all scripts" runs all the scripts and provides the performance metrics
- Keep in mind that the working directories are set to directories on my PC. Change these before running the scripts
